## Autonomous navigation
The notebooks contain resources and basic theoretical background about robotic navigation in ros. There are also guidelines for a project that shows how autonomous navigation 
can be implemented using ros and turtlebot. The project can take place in 'The ROS Development Studio by The Construct' with no Ros installation needed.

## Autonomous navigation with turtlebot
The folder contains the files needed for autonomous navigation with ros melodic and turtlebot. If you have Ros Melodic installed, you can clone the folder in your linux environment 
and run the commands in the Commands.txt file. You will see turtlebot3 performing autonomous navigation in a world that i have made with a map that i have already saved. 
Ros Melodic installation needed.

## Ros-Python scripts
The folder contains files in which i worked on with my team (Democritus Industrial Robotics team), for competing at RoboCup@Work League. In 'Python scripts' folder, there are scripts 
that allows our team's robot to approach a bench with the correct orientation and position. In 'State machine scripts in python' folder, there are necessary scripts with the 
state machine code for the task mentioned above.
